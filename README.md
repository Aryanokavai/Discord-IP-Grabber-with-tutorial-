# Discord-IP-Grabber-with-tutorial-
Here I provide the steps and files needed in order to pull IPS from Discord! You can also pull anyones IP no matter what app you are using!
Steps:
1. Create a discord server
2. Create a webhook within this server, then copy the webhook URL
3. Next, open the file I provided and replace the webhook URl already implemented with YOUR webhook URL. If you need help then just scroll down on the script until you find an existing webhook URL, then delete that one and then paste your webhook URL. You can do this in repl.it, visual studio code, or in your note pad.
4. Save the file. Make sure it remains a php file.
5. Go to https://www.000webhost.com/ then sign up if you don't already have an account. After going through the sign up process, it will ask you some questions. Just put random answers for these.
6. Name the project the name of the link that you want. It could be anything from "discord nuke bot" to "chicken nugget." This is important if you're trying to trick someone into clicking the link.
7. You will then be faced with 3 options. Choose "Upload your site."
8. Now look to your left and go to "public_html." 
9. Drag the php file you just created into the website. Click upload and the rename the file to what you named the project to.
10. Right click on the file and then click on view. Now you have your IP grabber link ready!
11. Go back to the discord server with the webhook and you should see your own IP logged there. 

Now have fun and get to stealing IPs!
